<h2>WebClient Tablet Interface</h2>

WebClient Tablet interface is optimized for touchscreens and the default choice for tablet browsers such as Safari on iPad, Chrome on Android tablets, or Silk on Kindle Fire. When you login from these devices, you will be automatically redirected to Tablet Interface.<br />

<br />

Tablet interface doesn't depend on JavaScript and is therefore compatible with old or mobile browser versions that cannot handle Full WebClient. All operations require only the left mouse button and clicking standard web elements like checkboxes, buttons and pull-down menus. There are no context menus or window pop-ups.<br />





<h2>Tap</h2>

<img src="../en/images/toolbaricons.jpg"/><br />

<br />

The icon toolbar gives you finger-friendly access to all the essential mail and groupware functions- divided into scopes that correspond to the colored icons in the upper menu.<br />

<ul>

	<li>Email</li>

	<li>Address Book</li>

	<li>Calendar</li>

	<li>Tasks</li>

	<li>Notes</li>

	<li>Files</li>

</ul>

<br />

To receive new messages, click the envelope icon at the top of the screen.<br />

<br />

<img src="../en/images/newitem.jpg"/><br />

<br />

To start composing a new message, create new contact or distribution list, new event or meeting invitation, new task, new note or upload a new file, click the corresponding icon in the toolbar and click the prominent New button.<br />

<br />

For today's messages, only the time is shown. For older emails, only the date is shown. If you want to see both the information, hover the mouse over it- the date and time is displayed. To see full headers, click the Details button.<br />





<h2>Rotate</h2>

<img src="../en/images/rotate.jpg"/><br />

<br />

Horizontal View shows all your favorite folders in a list on the left side. The current folder is in bold with a dot. To add more folders to the list, use Folder Management option.

Vertical View collapses the folder list into a drop-down selection to the right. Tap the button with the name of the current folder to access other folder options.<br />

<br />

<img src="../en/images/rotatefolders.jpg"/><br />

<br />

The Folder Management option allows you to access or create a shortcut to a folder that is not listed yet, and have it quickly accessible. It also allows to add, rename, remove folders or make a folder default.<br />



<h2>Swipe</h2>

<img src="../en/images/swipe.jpg"/><br />

<br />

Natural direction swiping is supported in all paging views (list of emails, contacts, all calendar views and so on) and allows you to advance and go back in the lists just like flipping through pages in a book:<br />

<br />

Next page: from right to left<br />

Previous page: from left to right (as on the picture above)<br />

<br />

<img src="../en/images/paging.jpg"/><br />

<br />

As an alternative to swiping with your finger, you can use paging controls at right (repeated at the top and bottom for easier access), which also show the current position and total number of pages.<br />

<br />

<img src="../en/images/browsing.jpg"/><br />

<br />

You can swipe between messages, contacts, notes and so on. As an alternative there are arrows to go to the next message or the previous one after opening a message.<br />





<h2>Fast Reply</h2>

<img src="../en/images/fastreply.jpg"/><br />

<br />

When you don't need special formatting or set delivery options, the Fast Reply gives you exactly that- a text area to reply to the original sender of the message you are currently viewing.<br />





<h2>Select</h2>

<img src="../en/images/selections.jpg"/><br />

<br />

This only applies to items on the current page

<ul>

	<li>to select all items on the page, use All, or limit selection to Read or Unread</li>

	<li>to deselect them use None</li>

	<li>use Invert selection to select all but those that currently have checkbox next to them</li>

</ul>

<br />

Or use the individual checkboxes next to each item in the list to make your selection and then perform actions with them.<br />

<br />

To select all messages in the folder, you may need to increase the number of listed items in Settings - General.<br />





<h2>Manage</h2>

<img src="../en/images/actions.jpg"/><br />

<br />

After having selected one or more items (the checkbox is ticked), you can carry an action on them using the actions buttons (e.g. Delete, then you will be asked to confirm the deletion).<br />

<br />

<img src="../en/images/actionslist.jpg"/><br />

<br />

You can select other infrequent actions from the Action: pulldown menu (e.g. Mark As Unread, Blacklist).<br />





<h2>Search</h2>

<img src="../en/images/search.jpg"/><br />

<br />

Type a phrase to search for and search in all aspects of the data currently displayed (in email subjects/senders/recipients, in contact names/addresses etc.) or use keywords to limit the search to a specific criteria (for example, subject:office). The list of available keywords is at the end of this help.<br />

<br />

To cancel the search, tap any toolbar icon or folder, or delete everything in the search toolbar and click Search.<br />





<h2>Fight Spam</h2>

<img src="../en/images/quarantine.jpg"/><br />

<br />

Use the Quarantine option in folder list to access your whitelist and blacklist. Here you can see email addresses that are always allowed or always rejected. You can delete the addresses or move them from blacklist to whitelist and vice versa.<br />

<br />

To add spam or unsolicited commercial message sender to a blacklist:

<ul>

	<li>in Quarantine list, select Blacklist folder and click New Item button</li>

	<li>in Email view, place a checkbox next to the email and select Blacklist from Actions: menu</li>

	<li>in Email view, place a checkbox next to the email, click Move and select </li>

</ul>

<br />

To make sure you can access your Spam folder from Copy/Move menu, use the Folder Management option and Link the Spam folder to pin in into your favorite folders list.<br />





<h2>Manage Folders</h2>

<img src="../en/images/fm_link.jpg"/><br />

<br />

Link folder means to create a link to this folder in the favorite folder list. A link allows you to have your most important folders easier accessible from folder list and in Copy/Move options. You can also name the link with a descriptive nameâ€“ it doesn't need to correspond with the actual folder name. The custom name will then appear in parenthesis in Folder Management tree.<br />

<br />

<img src="../en/images/fm_open.jpg"/><br />

<br />

Open folder by clicking the folder name is useful to access a folder that is not linked in the left menu, but you are not accessing the folder too often. The folder will open like any linked one.<br />

<br />

<img src="../en/images/fm_add.jpg"/><br />

<br />

Add folder creates a new folder. You need to specify the folder type- whether you will want to store mail, contacts or other types of items in the new folder.<br />

<br />

<img src="../en/images/fm_edit.jpg"/><br />

<br />

Rename folder will rename the folder. If there is a link to that folder in left menu, the link will not be affected.<br />

<br />

<img src="../en/images/fm_default.jpg"/><br />

<br />

Make default folder will change to where messages are received, sent or saved. Default folders are always accessible from the favorite folders list and cannot be renamed or deleted.<br />

<br />

<img src="../en/images/fm_remove.jpg"/><br />

<br />

Remove folder will permanently delete all contents of the folder (when you click "Empty") or permanently delete all contents of the folder and the folder itself (when you click "Delete").<br />





<h2>Customize</h2>

<img src="../en/images/toolbar.jpg"/><br />

<br />

Settings button (between the Help and the Logout icons in the top right corner) allow you to customize the Tablet interface. Various settings are organized into categories that appear as folders (on left side in tall view or on the right dropdown in wide view).<br />

<br />

<img src="../en/images/rotatesettings.jpg"/><br />

<br />

<ul>

	<li>General- change date/time format, specify number of items on page, enable Trash, automatically add recipients to contacts, change password and more</li>

	<li>Compose- set to always request read confirmations, always put sent messages to Sent folder, edit your signature, change default font and more</li>

	<li>Personalities- add/edit/delete multiple personalities (full name and email address as it appears to the email recipient)</li>

	<li>Autoresponder- an auto-reply function with useful settings like Respond Once to each recipient, respond only within certain hours of the day or never respond to select addresses</li>

	<li>Forwarder- to forward or copy incoming email messages to any other email address</li>

</ul>





<h2>Cancel</h2>

<img src="../en/images/backbutton.jpg"/><br />

<br />

Use the browser Back button to return where you were or cancel editing a message, contact, calendar. Any edits you did will be lost. Or just click any toolbar icon.<br />





<h2>Switch</h2>

<img src="../en/images/interfaces.jpg"/><br />

<br />

Using the links to Advanced Interface, Mobile Interface, you can quickly switch between interfaces, without needing to give your login name and password again. Advanced interface may not work if you are using an older or mobile browser.<br />





<h2>Smart Attach</h2>

<img src="../en/images/smartattach.jpg"/><br />

<br />

On Android tablets and in desktop browsers you can upload attachments to messages. Ticking the checkbox "Use SmartAttach" attachments will be stored on the server (and in your Files) and delivered via download links embedded in the email. This makes delivery to mobile users faster and more efficient.<br />





<h2>Search Keywords</h2>

<img src="../en/images/headers.jpg"/><br />

<br />

Not all keywords apply for all scopes, e.g. subject: applies only to email, while in calendar you need to use the title: keyword. Multiple keywords are by default linked with AND operator (no need to specify it) and all criteria must be met, or you can use OR and NOT logical operators so that the following criteria can be made optional or to find items not meeting the criteria.<br />

<br />

<strong>from</strong>: Used to specify the sender (from:Amy)<br />

<strong>to</strong>: Used to specify a recipient (to:David)<br />

<strong>subject</strong>: Search for words in the subject line (subject:Dinner)<br />

<strong>cc</strong>: Used to specify recipients in the Cc: field<br />

<strong>bcc</strong>: Used to specify recipients in the Bcc: field<br />

<strong>title</strong>: Used to specify item title (title:Test)<br />

<strong>description</strong>: Used to specify description or note (description:Test)<br />

<strong>name</strong>: Used to specify contact name<br />

<strong>email</strong>: Used to specify email<br />

<strong>keyword</strong>: Search for items with specified tag (tag:Business)<br />

<strong>tag</strong>: Search for items with specified tag (tag:Business)<br />

<strong>greater</strong>: Search depending on size in kB (greater:1024)<br />

<strong>smaller</strong>: Search depending on size in kB (smaller:1024)<br />

<strong>company</strong>: Search contacts against company (company:IceWarp)<br />

<strong>department</strong>: Search contacts against department (department:IT)<br />

<strong>location</strong>: Search contacts against location (location:London)<br />
